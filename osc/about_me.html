            <p id="about_p_1">I have always had a love for computers and computer programing. I grew up in a very artistic family, both my parents and my older sister are artists in one medium or another. I inherited their same desire and passion for creativity, but not the skills to express that in the normal mediums. In early elementry school I learned that, being good at math, Programing gave me an outlet for that creativity. I have been coding ever since. In high school I developed the coding style I practive today through being a teachers aid in my coding classes. I had to learn to code in a way that others could understand and use my code in their own programs. Outside of school I had limited time to work on my own projects, so I continued the practice of coding in an easily accesible way, so that I could adapt my code for future projects if needed, therfore being able to acomplish more with less time.</p>
            <p id="about_p_2">I am now in school refining my coding abilities, and expanding them through studing web development and design. I have worked for Nestle Stoffers assisting with IT, production team managment, and data entry. I now work for Bricks & Minifigs as a feild manager/support agent and work on their internal app development and maintaining their website. Every experience allowing me to build my abilities and broaden my knowledge. I am always looking to dive into new and exciting projects, and work with those that feel the same.</p>
