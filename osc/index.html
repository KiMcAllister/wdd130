The idea that someone can take something beyond the general publics ability to understand and break it down to easy, understandible parts has become known as a sign of true mastery and genius. With the world becoming more and more computer reliant, as computer programers and computer scientists, our goal should be to make the technological world as acessasble as possible. Gone is the day that self made geniuses aproach the complexities of computers from their basements, in is the day of mothers, entrepenuers, and people from all walks of life needing to be able to manipulate technology to their needs.</p></div>

Maybe the backend socket manager of your internal corporate messaging app doesnt need to be easy to use and impliment to function effectively, but I believe its essential for long term stability of a product. Thats my goal, and thats what I provide for all that I work with.</p></div>
