            <p id="portfolio_info">The best way to get to know me, my abilities, and the way I code, is through looking at the projects I have worked on. I have been programing for close to 10 years. I have done a lot of coding, here are just a few that I feel show off what I can do.</p>
            <p id="project_1">My personal website, the website you are on right now, was created from the ground up by me. This is the first proper website I have made. I am currently in school for web development with a hope to focus on backend devlopment, but a good practice for an web developer is a good knowledge of the back and frontend of the development process reguardless of their focus.</p>
            <p id="project_2">I have always loved the idea of making a game but don't have much artistic ability. As a result, when i had a friend that wanted to learn python better, and wanted to learn so through the creation of a game, we started working on a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game. Almost all the code in the game is written by me, with assistance from a few online tutorials adapted to my needs. It currently includes a base server program you can run and connect to with a seperate client program.</p>
            <p id="project_3">In my current job I help with internal app devolpment, two of the project I have worked on are greated in the Google Suite. I have created a webapp that allows our franchisees to book and manage bookings of corporate resources, and coordinate shipping across the country. It manages a google calendar, google sheet, and a group email address. The other google suite project I have created for them is a peronized mass emailing from template app. It allows you to connect up multiple google sheets, and include information from those sheets in the email based on the template (which is formated with a simple syntax I created).</p>
