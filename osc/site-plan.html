      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How do you know if a potential software engineer will fit your company's culture and coding standards? My goal with my portfolio website is to answer those two questions for you. You can get to know me not only through work history, personal description, and the projects I have pursued. You can get to know my coding standards and style through my on-website coding project examples. With this you can know if I will be a good fit for your company.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience for my site is people looking to hire a software engineer/computer programer. They will be well versed in computers and programing. Most of them will be in small and/or startup companies. They will be late ysa to middle life in age. They will be looking for a clean and crisp look on the site and code. THey will be interested in coding and people thought process behind what they code. Most will acess from their computer to see if I will fit their company needs.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        OSC or Overly-Simplified Complexity is an interesting topic. The idea that someone can take something beyond the general publics
        ability to understand and break it down to easy, understandible parts has become known as a sign of true mastery and genius. 
        With the world becoming more and more computer reliant, as computer programers and computer scientists, our goal should be to make
        the technological world as acessasble as possible. Gone is the day that self made geniuses aproach the complexities of computers
        from their basements, in is the day of mothers, entrepenuers, and people from all walks of life needing to be able to manipulate technology
        to their needs. I strive to code in a way that anyone can uderstand and use my code, no matter what their camputer background is. 
        Maybe the backend socket manager of your internal corporate messaging app doesnt need to be easy to use and impliment to function effectively,
         but I believe its essential for long term stability of a product. Thats my goal, and thats what I provide for all that I work with.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have always had a love for computers and computer programing. I grew up in a very artistic family, both my parents and my older sister are artists in one 
        medium or another. I inherited their same desire and passion for creativity, but not the skills to express that in the normal mediums. In early elementry school
        I learned that, being good at math, Programing gave me an outlet for that creativity. I have been coding ever since. In high school I developed the coding style 
        I practive today through being a teachers aid in my coding classes. I had to learn to code in a way that others could understand and use my code in their own 
        programs. Outside of school I had limited time to work on my own projects, so I continued the practice of coding in an easily accesible way, so that I could adapt
        my code for future projects if  needed, therfore being able to acomplish more with less time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now in school refining my coding abilities, and expanding them through studing web development and design. I have worked for Nestle Stoffers assisting with IT,
        production team managment, and data entry. I now work for Bricks & Minifigs as a feild manager/support agent and work on their internal app development and maintaining
         their website. Every experience allowing me to build my abilities and broaden my knowledge. I am always looking to dive into new and exciting projects, and work with 
         those that feel the same.

      <p>
        The best way to get to know me, my abilities, and the way I code, is through looking at the projects I have worked on.
        projects: Mud game, rafting site, see if I can find some of last years projects.
